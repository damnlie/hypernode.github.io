# Configuring nginx

Nginx does not use .htaccess files like Apache does. This means that
configuration previously done in .htaccess-files now has to be done in a
different format, explained in the [nginx
documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/).

Custom configuration to nginx can be made by placing files in the
`nginx`-directory inside your home directory. Files which name start
with `server.` will be parsed in the server context of nginx, files that
start with `http.` will be parsed in the http context.

When configuration files in the nginx-directory cannot be parsed by
nginx, a new file is created named `nginx_error_output` containing the
error message from nginx. It is advised to remove this file before
fixing the issue, since this file will not automatically be removed and
it might become unclear if the changed files are then installed or the
issue persists.

Some typical scenarios are explained here.

## Blocking or allowing certain IP addresses

Blocking addresses is done using the [access
module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_access_module.html). To
deny all access from certain addresses, create a file in the
`nginx`-directory in you homedir named `server.deny-something` (name
doesn't really matter, as long as it starts with `server.`), with the
following contents:

```nginx
deny 1.2.3.4;     # To deny a single server
deny 5.6.7.0/24;  # To deny a complete network
```

To deny access to everybody except certain addresses to a specific
directory, create a file called `server.private-dir` containing:

```nginx
location /private/ {
  allow 100.23.45.14;  ## Your specific IP
  deny all;
}
```

## Protecting a directory with a password

To restrict access to a location to users with a password, you can use
the same htpasswd file that is used with Apache. To restrict access to a
location, you can use the [auth
basic](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html)
directive.

For example, to restrict access to the preview-directory using users and
passwords specified in the file `/data/web/public/preview/.htpasswd`,
create a file called `server.preview-auth` containing:

```nginx
location /preview/ {
  auth_basic "Restricted area";
  auth_basic_user_file /data/web/public/preview/.htpasswd;
}
```

## Rewriting or redirecting URLs

The default Magento rewrite rules are already preconfigured for you. The
[rewrite
module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html) of
nginx has a different syntax, but is generally easier. To rewrite all
URL's in the format of `/invoice/345232.pdf` to `/invoice.php?id=345232`
you would create a file called `server.rewrite-invoices` containing:

```nginx
rewrite ^/invoice/(\d+).pdf$ /invoice.php?id=$1 break;
```

If you want to redirect instead of rewrite, you can specify the rewrite
target as a full URL starting with `http://` or `https://`, or you can
add the `redirect`-flag to the end of the rule for a 302 temporary
redirect, or `permanent` for a 301 permanent redirect.

## Run codes/run types for Magento

If your shop needs the `MAGE_RUN_CODE` or `MAGE_RUN_TYPE` environment
variables set, you can create a file called `server.mage-run-env`
containing:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
  fastcgi_param MAGE_RUN_CODE default;
  fastcgi_param MAGE_RUN_TYPE store;
}
```

If these variables need to be set depending on the value of the http
Host-header, you can add a map in the `http`-context. Create a file
called `http.mage-run-maps` containing:

```nginx
map $http_host $storecode {
  hostnames;
  default default;
  *.storefront1.com store1storecode.com
  www.storefront2.com store2storecode.com
}

map $http_host $storetype {
  hostnames;
  default store;
  something.example.com othertype
}
```

In the `server`-context, the variables `$storecode` and `$storetype` can
now be used to set the environment variables. In `server-mage-run-env`:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
  fastcgi_param MAGE_RUN_CODE $storecode;
  fastcgi_param MAGE_RUN_TYPE $storetype;
}
```
