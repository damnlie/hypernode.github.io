## Welcome to the Hypernode pilot project!

Your new Hypernode is ready to boost your customer's shop! Notable advantages:

1. Speedier, thanks to a new PHP version, opcache cache, local storage, local database access, dedicated query cache, low latency local Redis.
1. No BPU metering, no more PHP execution time limit.

You should have received a preview address, such as 
`<site>.test.hypernode.io`. This is a very recent snapshot of your 
shop (files + database) and enables you to make a very realistic comparison.

### Procedure

1. You are invited to browse your customer's shop on the given preview address. Use the checklist below to verify its functioning.
1. When you are happy with the results, send us an OK.
1. We will issue a re-sync of your files and data and change the DNS for your domain(s) to the new node.
    * In case of external DNS control, we will propose a specific timeslot, as the migration of data and DNS has to happen at the same time.

If you find anything missing, please discuss it with us @ `hypernode@byte.nl`.

### Changes

#### Changes to the software stack

Hypernodes run on a complete different software stack. This means that some minor functionality might differ from the current platform. Notable differences:

1. Database and redis server names have changed to `mysqlmaster1.<tag>.hypernode.io` and `redismaster1.<tag>.hypernode.io`.
1. Our new webserver Nginx does not support `.htaccess` files (so it is faster). We handle most Magento .htaccess functionality out of the box, but if you have added custom functionality to one or more htaccess files, you should check that it works under Nginx: **TODO** insert instructions.
    1. Client IP blocks
    1. Folders with password protection
    1. URL redirects
    1. URL rewrites
    1. Magento RUN CODES and TYPES.
1. All file uploads should be done by using SCP, RSYNC or SFTP. Regular FTP is disabled for security reasons. You should use host `<tag>.hypernode.io` and user `app` for SSH and SCP operations. 
1. Password access is disabled. The nodes use your SSH public keys that you can manage on the Byte [service panel](https://service.byte.nl/sshkeymanager/).
1. Redis doesn't require a password.
1. Installed PHP is version 5.4. Magento 1.6+ officially support it, but some versions require a patch. See the [Magento announcement](http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/magento-now-supports-php-54/) for the patch.
1. We backup in case of hardware failures, but there are (as of yet) not historical backups. If you need them, we advice you to use the supplied program with offsite storage (such as S3). **TODO** insert historical backup recommendation.
1. New Relic is temporarily disabled (it's on our todo list).
1. The absolute path to the document root has changed to /data/web/public. Non-public files (such as credentials) should go into /data/web.

#### Things we've converted for you

While setting up your preview environment, we've automatically converted the following things. Take these into account if you run a git clone of your codebase on our servers (and preferably merge those changes into your own repo). 

1. Any hardcoded paths found (starting with /home/users) are automatically replaced (in text files and your database data). Absolute paths in binary data (such as SQLite databases) might not have been replaced, so you should check those.
1. Symlinks pointing to hardcoded paths are replaced with their relative counterparts.
1. Your `local.xml` is updated so it contains the new database and redis hostnames.

Specifically for the preview, we've changed some temporary things. Those will obviously not be applied when your live shop migrates.
* Base URLs for your store fronts are updated in the database (so you'll be able to test using the *.hypernode.io domain). 
* A very restrictive `robots.txt` is installed so your preview shop won't get indexed by Google and others. 

### Checklist

_Important_: When browsing your preview shop, doublecheck that you don't end up on your production shop by following a hardcoded link. 

- ☐  Test all storefronts (stick `.test.hypernode.io` to the url)
- ☐  Test frontpage, categories, product pages
- ☐  Test search
- ☐  Test restricted areas (downloads, etc).
- ☐  Test ordering a product
- ☐  Test common tasks in the admin backend (ie, add product)
- ☐  Test import/export procedures
- ☐  Test custom administrative procedures

_Important_: Before go live 

- ☐  Do you have a historical backup of the database?
- ☐  Do you have (need) a historical backup of your files or can you redeploy from Git?
